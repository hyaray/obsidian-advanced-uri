# Commands

There are two ways to identify a command.
- `commandname` That's the one you see when searching in Obsidian's command palette
- `commandid` That's invisible to the user, can be found at `.obsidian\hotkty.json` if defined hotkey, also can read from the plugin's source code

:::info
Using the command's ID is strongly recommended, because it's not likely to change. Using [Helper Commands](../tips/helper_commands.md) the ID is automatically obtained.
:::

In the following `<command>` can be replaced with either `commandname` or `commandid`.
